# Lunar Lander Simulator

- Developed a simulator that models the precise landing of the Apollo 11 Lunar Lander Module.
- Rigourously tested and debugged the program to ensure exactness when modelling the landing of the Module.
- Accurately models the Lunar Lander by calculating gravitational force of the moon, velocity and acceleration due to thrust and gravity, and position mapping.
