# Orbit Simulator

- Built a program that models several satellites in geostationary orbit around Earth.
- Created a design document that describes the relationship between objects using UML Class Diagrams, Structure Charts,
pseudocode, and flowcharts.
- Tested and debugged the program to ensure completeness using Unit Tests and Test Driven Development.
